# Generate Checkerboard Pattern Image using Python

This repository contains a Python script to generate a checkerboard pattern image. It demonstrates the use of image processing libraries and techniques for creating simple patterns.

## Features

- Create customizable checkerboard patterns.
- Adjustable square size and grid dimensions.
- Save the generated pattern as an image file.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maroofhasankhan/Generate-checkerboard-pattern-image-using-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Generate-checkerboard-pattern-image-using-python
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `checkerboard.py` script in your code editor.
2. Adjust the parameters for the checkerboard pattern:
   - `square_size`: Size of each square in the checkerboard.
   - `grid_size`: Number of squares along one side of the checkerboard.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python checkerboard.py
   ```
4. The generated image will be displayed and saved in the project directory.
